## Which permissions are used?

Location permission is needed to calculate the distance between the user's position and the given capital.
The user's permission is not saved.
If the user does not accept the permission, no data will be shown for the distance value.
So the location permission is not mandatory.

In shared preferences are capitals saved which are marked as favorite.
Users can delete this stored data.

Network permission is mandatory for the first start to load the data.

## What happens with user data?

No user data is collected.
